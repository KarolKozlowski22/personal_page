My name is Karol Kozłowski. I was born on May 10, 2002, in Sosnowc in the city hospital at Emila Zegadłowicza Street, 3.0.1.2.0.

00:14.080 --> 00:17.860
Mother Agnieszka, father Tomasz, I greet you.

00:17.920 --> 00:21.720
The city of my origin is the place where everyone laughs in Poland.

00:22.240 --> 00:24.160
Honestly, I don't know why.

00:24.860 --> 00:28.080
It's ugly, but I saw it uglier and we don't have a market.

00:28.980 --> 00:35.180
Currently, I live in Warsaw, in the so-called city of miracles, innovations and moments of degeneration.

00:35.820 --> 00:37.040
And this is quite serious.

00:37.380 --> 00:43.500
I like our capital because it shows me how our state has developed since the time of economic transformation.

00:44.180 --> 00:47.240
No need for information is like a lesson, never too little.

00:48.100 --> 00:53.720
I work as an engineer devops for one of the world's largest fintechs in the world, Visa Incorporated.

00:54.440 --> 00:59.680
Remember, dear viewers, Visa is not a bank or a debit or credit card creator,

01:00.560 --> 01:04.300
but a global system of calculating money between financial institutions,

01:04.500 --> 01:09.500
i.e. such a very advanced machine to move numbers from place to place.

01:10.620 --> 01:16.220
Devops sounds exotic, but in practice it is about ensuring a single-scale infrastructure

01:16.220 --> 01:20.620
for IT projects and a wide range of automation processes.

01:20.620 --> 01:26.780
In order not to get bored with buzzwords, I invite you to the section dedicated to my experience,

01:27.220 --> 01:28.700
where I describe it a little more broadly.

01:29.440 --> 01:32.340
What do I have in common with Kozłami, apart from the slang-sounding name?

01:33.080 --> 01:37.000
Yes, I record a podcast talking to Kozłami, from young people for everyone.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.940
You will find the link on the page or in the section dedicated to the podcast.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.100
I am also a private investor.

01:43.640 --> 01:48.500
In practice, it means that some of the hard-earned money I have already managed to lose both

01:48.500 --> 01:51.080
and multiply in the cryptocurrency market.

01:51.700 --> 01:58.680
And seriously, I think that the current monetary system and a wide range of macroeconomic conditions

01:58.680 --> 02:01.040
are strongly pushing the middle class.

02:01.600 --> 02:06.060
Therefore, investing is one of the few trampolines to the front.

02:06.700 --> 02:09.780
Remember, however, that investing is involved with the risk

02:09.780 --> 02:12.340
and it is absolutely not an investment order.

02:13.000 --> 02:20.600
And I have honest hope that you will not listen to any of the local Warsaw network from the Internet.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.200
Education is also something that has happened.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.760
I have finished the information used for AGH.

02:27.320 --> 02:30.440
Currently, I am in the course of major studies in the Warsaw Polytechnic,

02:31.420 --> 02:34.080
although at the moment I pressed the URLOB-Dziekański,

02:34.100 --> 02:37.980
to live a little and make some projects outside of the university.

02:37.980 --> 02:42.660
In short, I study, but with a distance to academic drama.

02:43.460 --> 02:46.780
My motto is to be hearty in your knowledge and praise.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.080
What kind of book is this?

02:49.320 --> 02:50.340
Okay, that's enough.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.800
That's enough for health and to click on the content well.
