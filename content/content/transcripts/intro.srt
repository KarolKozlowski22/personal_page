00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,580
My name is Karol Kozłowski. I was born on May 10, 2002, in Sosnowc in the city hospital at Emila Zegadłowicza Street, 3.0.1.2.0.

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,860
Mother Agnieszka, father Tomasz, I greet you.

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,720
The city of my origin is the place where everyone laughs in Poland.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,160
Honestly, I don't know why.

5
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,080
It's ugly, but I saw it uglier and we don't have a market.

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,180
Currently, I live in Warsaw, in the so-called city of miracles, innovations and moments of degeneration.

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,040
And this is quite serious.

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,500
I like our capital because it shows me how our state has developed since the time of economic transformation.

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,240
No need for information is like a lesson, never too little.

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,720
I work as an engineer devops for one of the world's largest fintechs in the world, Visa Incorporated.

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,680
Remember, dear viewers, Visa is not a bank or a debit or credit card creator,

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,300
but a global system of calculating money between financial institutions,

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,500
i.e. such a very advanced machine to move numbers from place to place.

14
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:16,220
Devops sounds exotic, but in practice it is about ensuring a single-scale infrastructure

15
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,620
for IT projects and a wide range of automation processes.

16
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:26,780
In order not to get bored with buzzwords, I invite you to the section dedicated to my experience,

17
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,700
where I describe it a little more broadly.

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,340
What do I have in common with Kozłami, apart from the slang-sounding name?

19
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes, I record a podcast talking to Kozłami, from young people for everyone.

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,940
You will find the link on the page or in the section dedicated to the podcast.

21
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,100
I am also a private investor.

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,500
In practice, it means that some of the hard-earned money I have already managed to lose both

23
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,080
and multiply in the cryptocurrency market.

24
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:58,680
And seriously, I think that the current monetary system and a wide range of macroeconomic conditions

25
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,040
are strongly pushing the middle class.

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,060
Therefore, investing is one of the few trampolines to the front.

27
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,780
Remember, however, that investing is involved with the risk

28
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,340
and it is absolutely not an investment order.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,600
And I have honest hope that you will not listen to any of the local Warsaw network from the Internet.

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,200
Education is also something that has happened.

31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,760
I have finished the information used for AGH.

32
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,440
Currently, I am in the course of major studies in the Warsaw Polytechnic,

33
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,080
although at the moment I pressed the URLOB-Dziekański,

34
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,980
to live a little and make some projects outside of the university.

35
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,660
In short, I study, but with a distance to academic drama.

36
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,780
My motto is to be hearty in your knowledge and praise.

37
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,080
What kind of book is this?

38
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,340
Okay, that's enough.

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,800
That's enough for health and to click on the content well.
