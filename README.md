# Personal Page (Next.js 14 + MDX + Podcast RSS)

A modern personal website built with Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui primitives, and framer-motion.

## Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui style components (Radix-based)
- framer-motion animations
- lucide-react icons
- MDX/Markdown content in `/content`
- RSS parsing for podcast episodes at build time

## Quick Start

pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Run with Docker (Local)

### Option A: Docker Compose (recommended)

1. Create env file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

2. Build and start container:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

3. Open:

`http://localhost:3000`

## Content Editing

All primary content is local and file-based:

- `content/education.pl.mdx` and `content/education.en.mdx`
- `content/career-current.pl.mdx` and `content/career-current.en.mdx`
- `content/experience.pl.mdx` and `content/experience.en.mdx`
- `content/podcast.pl.mdx` and `content/podcast.en.mdx`
- `content/shorts.json`
- `content/intro.srt` and `content/intro-transcript.json`

Podcast episodes are auto-synced from RSS using `PODCAST_RSS_URL`.

## Site Config

Edit global site identity and links in:

- `src/config/site.ts`

Config includes:

- Site name, author, role, location
- Social links
- Podcast RSS feed URL (env override supported)
- Voice intro audio/image source used on homepage narrator card
- Locale toggle (`PL/EN`) is in the top navigation and persists via cookie (`site_locale`)

## Voice Intro (Local MP3 + Transcript)

Homepage voice card uses:

- `public/audio/intro.mp3`
- `content/intro-transcript.json` (timestamped subtitles)
- `content/intro.srt` (editable subtitle source)

Optional settings live in `src/config/site.ts` under `voiceIntro`.
